# Exp - 5 STUDENT ENROLLMENT SYSTEM

# AIM:
To develop a project Student Registration System using Rational Rose Software and to implement
the software in Java.

# SRS (Procedure):
Student Registration: The STUDENT initiates the process by sending a REGISTERS request (1) to the
REGISTRAR.
Registration Approval: The REGISTRAR sends an APPROVES REG message (2) back to the STUDENT,
confirming registration approval.
Course Enrollment: The STUDENT then sends an ENROLLS COURSE request (3) to the SYSTEM.
Details Passing: The SYSTEM sends PASSES DETAILS (4) to the FACULTY for review.
Enrollment Acceptance: The FACULTY sends an ACCEPTS ENROLLMENT (5) message back to the
SYSTEM.
Confirmation Display: The SYSTEM sends a DISPLAYS APPROVED MSG (6) to the STUDENT,
confirming the successful course enrollment.
